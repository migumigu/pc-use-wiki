# Bytebot Architecture

How Bytebot's desktop agent works under the hood

## Overview

Bytebot is a self-hosted AI desktop agent built with a modular architecture. It combines a Linux desktop environment with AI to create an autonomous computer user that can perform tasks through natural language instructions.

## System Architecture

The system consists of four main components that work together:

### 1. Bytebot Desktop Container

The foundation of the system - a virtual Linux desktop that provides:

- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** base for stability and compatibility
- **XFCE4 Desktop** for a lightweight, responsive UI
- **bytebotd Daemon** - The automation service built on nutjs that executes computer actions
- **Pre-installed Applications**: Firefox ESR, Thunderbird, text editors, and development tools
- **noVNC** for remote desktop access

**Key Features:**
- Runs completely isolated from your host system
- Consistent environment across different platforms
- Can be customized with additional software
- Accessible via REST API on port 9990
- MCP SSE endpoint available at `/mcp`
- Uses shared types from `@bytebot/shared` package

### 2. AI Agent Service

The brain of the system - orchestrates tasks using an LLM:

- **NestJS Framework** for robust, scalable backend
- **LLM Integration** supporting Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, and Google Gemini models
- **WebSocket Support** for real-time updates
- **Computer Use API Client** to control the desktop
- **Prisma ORM** for database operations
- **Tool definitions** for computer actions (mouse, keyboard, screenshots)

**Responsibilities:**
- Interprets natural language requests
- Plans sequences of computer actions
- Manages task state and progress
- Handles errors and retries
- Provides real-time task updates via WebSocket

### 3. Web Task Interface

The user interface for interacting with your AI agent:

- **Next.js 15 Application** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Embedded VNC Viewer** to watch the desktop in action
- **Task Management** UI with status badges
- **WebSocket Connections** for live updates
- **Reusable components** for consistent UI
- **API utilities** for streamlined server communication

**Features:**
- Task creation and management interface
- Desktop tab for direct manual control
- Real-time desktop viewer with takeover mode
- Task history and status tracking
- Responsive design for all devices

### 4. PostgreSQL Database

Persistent storage for the agent system:

- **Tasks Table**: Stores task details, status, and metadata
- **Messages Table**: Stores AI conversation history
- **Prisma ORM** for type-safe database access

## Data Flow

### Task Execution Flow

1. **User Input**: User describes a task in natural language via the chat UI
2. **Task Creation**: Agent service creates a task record and adds it to the processing queue
3. **AI Planning**: The LLM analyzes the task and generates a plan of computer actions
4. **Action Execution**: Agent sends computer actions to bytebotd via REST API or MCP
5. **Desktop Automation**: bytebotd executes actions (mouse, keyboard, screenshots) on the desktop
6. **Result Processing**: Agent receives results, updates task status, and continues or completes
7. **User Feedback**: Results and status updates are sent back to the user in real-time

## Security Architecture

### Isolation Layers

1. **Container Isolation**
   - Each desktop runs in its own Docker container
   - No access to host filesystem by default
   - Network isolation with explicit port mapping

2. **Process Isolation**
   - bytebotd runs as non-root user
   - Separate processes for different services
   - Resource limits enforced by Docker

3. **Network Security**
   - Services only accessible from localhost by default
   - Can be configured with authentication
   - HTTPS/WSS for external connections

### API Security

- **Desktop API**: No authentication by default (localhost only). Supports REST and MCP.
- **Agent API**: Can be secured with API keys
- **Database**: Password protected, not exposed externally

Default configuration is for development. For production:
- Enable authentication on all APIs
- Use HTTPS/WSS for all connections
- Implement network policies
- Rotate credentials regularly

## Deployment Patterns

### Single User (Development)
```
Services: All on one machine
Scale: 1 instance each
Use Case: Personal automation, development
Resources: 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores
```

### Production Deployment
```
Services: All services on dedicated hardware
Scale: Single instance (1 agent, 1 desktop)
Use Case: Business automation
Resources: 8GB+ RAM, 4+ CPU cores
```

### Enterprise Deployment
```
Services: Kubernetes orchestration
Scale: Single instance with high availability
Use Case: Organization-wide automation
Resources: Dedicated nodes
```

## Extension Points

### Custom Tools

Add specialized software to the desktop:
```
FROM bytebot/desktop:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
  your-custom-tools
```

### AI Integrations

Extend agent capabilities:
- Custom tools for the LLM
- Additional AI models
- Specialized prompts
- Domain-specific knowledge

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage

- **Desktop Container**: ~1GB RAM idle, 2GB+ active
- **Agent Service**: ~256MB RAM
- **UI Service**: ~128MB RAM
- **Database**: ~256MB RAM

### Optimization Tips

1. Allocate sufficient resources to containers
2. Limit concurrent tasks to prevent overload
3. Monitor resource usage regularly
4. Use LiteLLM proxy for provider flexibility
