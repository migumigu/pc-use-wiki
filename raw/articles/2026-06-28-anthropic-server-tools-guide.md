# Server tools

Work with Anthropic-executed tools: server_tool_use blocks, pause_turn continuation, and domain filtering.

This page covers the shared mechanics of server-executed tools: the `server_tool_use` block, `pause_turn` continuation, ZDR considerations, and domain filtering. For individual tools, see the [tool reference](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-reference).

## The server_tool_use block

The `server_tool_use` block appears in Claude's response when a server-executed tool runs. Its `id` field uses the `srvtoolu_` prefix to distinguish it from client tool calls:

```
{
 "type": "server_tool_use",
 "id": "srvtoolu_01A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9",
 "name": "web_search",
 "input": { "query": "latest quantum computing breakthroughs" }
}
```
The API executes the tool internally. You see the call and its result in the response, but you don't handle execution. Unlike client `tool_use` blocks, you don't need to respond with a `tool_result`. The result block appears immediately after the `server_tool_use` block in the same assistant turn.

## The server-side loop and pause_turn

When using server tools like web search, the API may return a `pause_turn` stop reason, indicating that the API has paused a long-running turn.

Here's how to handle the `pause_turn` stop reason:

```python
# Initial request with web search
response = client.messages.create(
 model="claude-opus-4-8",
 max_tokens=1024,
 messages=[
 {
 "role": "user",
 "content": "Search for comprehensive information about quantum computing breakthroughs in 2025",
 }
 ],
 tools=[{"type": "web_search_20250305", "name": "web_search", "max_uses": 10}],
)

# Check if the response has pause_turn stop reason
if response.stop_reason == "pause_turn":
 # Continue the conversation with the paused content
 messages = [
 {
 "role": "user",
 "content": "Search for comprehensive information about quantum computing breakthroughs in 2025",
 },
 {"role": "assistant", "content": response.content},
 ]

 # Send the continuation request
 continuation = client.messages.create(
 model="claude-opus-4-8",
 max_tokens=1024,
 messages=messages,
 tools=[{"type": "web_search_20250305", "name": "web_search", "max_uses": 10}],
 )

 print(continuation)
else:
 print(response)
```
When handling `pause_turn`:

- **Continue the conversation:**  Pass the paused response back as-is in a subsequent request to let Claude continue its turn

- **Modify if needed:**  You can optionally modify the content before continuing if you want to interrupt or redirect the conversation

- **Preserve tool state:**  Include the same tools in the continuation request to maintain functionality

## ZDR and allowed_callers

The basic versions of web search (`web_search_20250305`) and web fetch (`web_fetch_20250910`) are eligible for [Zero Data Retention (ZDR)](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention).

The `_20260209` and later versions with dynamic filtering are **not**  ZDR-eligible by default because dynamic filtering relies on code execution internally.

To use a `_20260209` or later server tool with ZDR, disable dynamic filtering by setting `"allowed_callers": ["direct"]` on the tool:

```
{
 "type": "web_search_20260209",
 "name": "web_search",
 "allowed_callers": ["direct"]
}
```
This restricts the tool to direct invocation only, bypassing the internal code execution step.

Even when web fetch is used in a ZDR-eligible configuration, website publishers may retain any parameters passed to the URL if Claude fetches content from their site.

## Domain filtering

Server tools that access the web accept `allowed_domains` and `blocked_domains` parameters to control which domains Claude can reach.

When using domain filters:

- Domains should not include the HTTP/HTTPS scheme (use `example.com` instead of `https://example.com`)

- Subdomains are automatically included (`example.com` covers `docs.example.com`)

- Specific subdomains restrict results to only that subdomain (`docs.example.com` returns only results from that subdomain, not from `example.com` or `api.example.com`)

- Subpaths are supported and match anything after the path (`example.com/blog` matches `example.com/blog/post-1`)

- You can use either `allowed_domains` or `blocked_domains`, but not both in the same request

**Wildcard support:**

- Only one wildcard (`*`) is allowed per domain entry, and it must appear after the domain part (in the path)

- Valid: `example.com/*`, `example.com/*/articles`

- Invalid: `*.example.com`, `ex*.com`, `example.com/*/news/*`

Invalid domain formats return an `invalid_tool_input` tool error.

Request-level domain restrictions must be compatible with organization-level domain restrictions configured in Claude Console. Request-level domains can only further restrict domains, not override or expand beyond the organization-level list. If your request includes domains that conflict with organization settings, the API returns a validation error.

Be aware that Unicode characters in domain names can create security vulnerabilities through homograph attacks, where visually similar characters from different scripts can bypass domain filters. For example, `аmazon.com` (using Cyrillic 'а') may appear identical to `amazon.com` but represents a different domain.

When configuring domain allow/block lists:

- Use ASCII-only domain names when possible

- Consider that URL parsers may handle Unicode normalization differently

- Test your domain filters with potential homograph variations

- Regularly audit your domain configurations for suspicious Unicode characters

## Dynamic filtering with code execution

The `_20260209` and later versions of web search and web fetch use code execution internally to apply dynamic filters against search results.

Including a standalone `code_execution` tool alongside `_20260209` or later versions of web tools creates two execution environments, which can confuse the model. Use one or the other, or pin both to the same version.

## Streaming server-tool events

Server-tool events stream as part of the normal SSE flow. The `server_tool_use` block and its result arrive as `content_block_start` and `content_block_delta` events, the same way text and client tool calls stream.

See [Streaming](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/streaming) for the full event reference. Individual tool pages document tool-specific event names where they differ.

## Batch requests

All server tools support batch processing. In a batch, the agentic loop runs just as it does for synchronous requests, with a higher per-turn iteration limit. If the loop reaches that limit, the response ends with `stop_reason: "pause_turn"`; you can continue it by submitting a follow-up request with the returned content. See [Server tools and the agentic loop](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing#server-tools-and-the-agentic-loop) for details.

Common batch workloads for server tools include enriching a dataset or catalog with information pulled from the web, checking a large set of documents against current sources, monitoring a list of pages or topics over time, and running analysis code over many files.
